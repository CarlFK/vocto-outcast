Files used with voctomix.

# Getting started / Demo:
Install the dependencies listed here:
https://github.com/voc/voctomix#installation
```
git clone https://github.com/voc/voctomix.git
git clone https://github.com/CarlFK/voctomix-outcasts.git

You should see the gui with 2 bouncing ball test feeds.
It is also saving to foo.ts
